# MY-Stack

A personal project for learning and experimenting with full-stack development using HTML, CSS, and related technologies.

---

## Project Description

This repository contains my experiments and learning projects as I explore full-stack web development. My goal is to understand the core technologies and best practices involved in building modern web applications.

- **Technologies Used:**  
  - HTML  
  - CSS  
  - (More technologies will be added as the project grows)

## Purpose

This repo is primarily for my own practice and learning. There are no polished projects or tutorials hereâ€”just a collection of files and experiments as I explore web development.

## Website

You can view the live site here: [MY-Stack](https://alexjones0801.github.io/MY-Stack/)

## GitHub Pages

I'm also using this repository to learn about and experiment with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which lets me host static sites directly from my code.

## License

This project is for educational and personal learning purposes.
