# 🌐 MY-Stack

A personal hub for learning, experimenting, and building web development projects using **HTML**, **CSS**, and eventually full-stack technologies.

## 📘 About This Project

**MY-Stack** is a hands-on learning project where I explore the foundations of front-end and full-stack web development. It serves as both a practice ground and a structured learning resource for myself (and maybe others too!).

This repo is organized into:
- 📂 `html/` — All basic HTML tags and elements (headings, tables, forms, etc.)
- 🎨 `css/` — Core CSS concepts (display, position, animation, etc.)
- ⚙️ `js/` *(coming soon)* — JavaScript files for DOM, logic, and interactivity
- 💡 `projects/` *(coming soon)* — Mini projects that combine multiple concepts

## 🚀 Live Website

Access the full interactive hub here:  
🔗 [https://alexjones0801.github.io/MY-Stack/](https://alexjones0801.github.io/MY-Stack/)

The site is built with **HTML + Bootstrap 5**, and uses **GitHub Pages** to host everything as a fully static front-end learning portal.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

Currently using:
- **HTML5** — Structure & markup
- **CSS3** — Styling & layout
- **Bootstrap 5** — Responsive UI components

Coming soon:
- **JavaScript**
- **Form validations**
- **Projects**
- **Maybe React/Node later?** 👀

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is:
- My personal dev lab 🧪
- A place to track what I’ve learned
- A stepping stone to more advanced tech

It’s not meant to be polished or production-grade. You’ll find raw files, sandbox-style demos, and work-in-progress experiments.

---

## 🛠️ GitHub Pages Setup

Using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host and serve all files. Each folder contains its own `index.html` to display its contents with a clean, Bootstrap-powered layout.
